# website
This is a placeholder for the decodecrew.com website

### The idea
There will an index page where each one of us will have a square that will link to our webpage. In that webpage you are free to implement whatever you want (games,pics,algorithms etc). This can have many webpages linked to each other. Just let you creativity free!

### Issues
Also, list suggestions for the index page style as **Issues** and someone will assign the issue to himself and have a crack at it. To do that while in the website repo, click **Issues** (second tab from the left, under the DeCodeCrew/website name) and click the green button on the right labeled **New issue**. Then just write a title and the description and submit it. Your issue with get a number and can now be found under the **Issues** tab. You can comment on it or assign it to someone by clicking the cog icon on the right side, next to the **Assignees** label.

### How to work
1. Clone the this repo to your laptop(either command-line or with the github desktop app or with any IDE you may be using). If you dont know how to clone, check this out: [how to clone](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/)
 
2. Now you should have all the files saved in a folder(named *website*) locally. Before you start working sync your local folder to the online version, which is github. To do that either use `git pull` on command line or sync through the desktop app. This ensures that you have the latest files and prevents conflicts when pushing your latest work. 

After you pull/sync start working locally on  your *.html*, *.css* and *.js* files. Once you are done, commit (always with a useful message!!!) and push your changes.
